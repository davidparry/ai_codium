# Java Refactoring Demo with Codium.ai
## ****** DISCLAIMER ****** 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate significant refactoring needs. It is used in presentations to illustrate 
the effectiveness of codium.ai as a collaborative tool in addressing complex Java projects.

## Project Summary
This project is a practical example used to demonstrate the Codium.ai plugin's capabilities in refactoring Java code. 
The objective is to show how Codium.ai can be a valuable tool for developers to enhance code quality, boost performance, 
and simplify the structure of Java applications.

## Key Features

- **Code Quality Enhancement:** Understand how Codium.ai detects and resolves code issues, improves readability, 
- and applies best practices in a Java project environment.

- **Performance Optimization:** Learn how Codium.ai identifies and suggests solutions for performance issues, 
- thereby improving the speed and efficiency of your application.

- **Modularization:** Discover the role of Codium.ai in transforming a monolithic structure into more modular, 
- maintainable, and reusable code segments.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.
